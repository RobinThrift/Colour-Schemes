# Colour Schemes

These are some colour schemes that I have found around the web, that don't have any
way of using them outside of their application/website. The original sources are all linked
below. All schemes are based on the [base-16 colors.yml](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder/blob/master/schemes/colors.yml).

- Seti based on [jesseweed/seti-syntax](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-syntax)


## Building
Run `./builder -s path/to/scheme` or `./builder` to just build all schemes.
